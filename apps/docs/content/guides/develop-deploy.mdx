Supabase provides several tools to make developing and deploying your application easier:

- Spin up the Supabase stack for local development by using the [Supabase CLI](/docs/guides/develop-deploy/cli)
- Sync your production database and application with the [GitHub integration](/docs/guides/develop-deploy/github-integration)
- Create both persistent and ephemeral preview environments with [branching](/docs/guides/develop-deploy/branching)
- Develop flexible [CI workflows](/docs/guides/develop-deploy/ci) with the CLI
