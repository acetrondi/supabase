Most production applications are developed and deployed in several environments, from development to staging to production. Each environment has different safety and robustness guarantees.

You can use Supabase in all environments where you develop your application. Supabase has several tools for managing the development lifecycle, including the [Supabase CLI](/docs/guides/develop-deploy/cli), [branching](/docs/guides/develop-deploy/branching), and more.

## Development stages

Most applications have at least three different development and deployment envrionments:

1. Local development. This might run on the developer's machine, or in an ephemeral cloud container, if using a cloud development environment such as GitHub Codespaces or GitPod.
1. Staging or preview. There might be several of these environments, which might be persistent or ephemeral (lasting for the lifetime of a feature branch).
1. Production. This is the environment end users interact with.

Each of these stages should be using a different Supabase instance. Supabase provides:

1. The Supabase CLI, to run a local Supabase stack for development.
1. Branching, to maintain multiple persistent or ephemeral preview environments.
1. Continous integration abilities, to safely and securely sync your changes to production once they are approved.
